# PrivAudit - Privacy-Preserving DAO Treasury Reports

![PrivAudit Logo](apps/web/public/images/privaudit-logo.png)

A cutting-edge decentralized application that generates AI-powered, privacy-preserving treasury reports for DAOs using zero-knowledge proofs. Built for maximum security, transparency, and decentralization.

## 🌟 Overview

**PrivAudit** is a production-ready solution that revolutionizes DAO treasury management by combining privacy-preserving technologies with advanced analytics.

### The Challenge
DAOs worldwide struggle with treasury management transparency. Traditional financial reporting either exposes sensitive data or provides insufficient visibility for stakeholders and regulatory compliance.

### Our Solution
PrivAudit addresses this critical need by combining:
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs)** for proving solvency without revealing transaction details
- **Midnight.js Integration** for private data handling
- **AI-Powered Analysis** for generating comprehensive reports
- **Real Blockchain Data** fetched from Etherscan and other APIs

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Privacy-First Architecture
- **Zero-Knowledge Solvency Proofs**: Prove DAO solvency (assets ≥ liabilities) without exposing amounts
- **Midnight.js Integration**: Secure private data ingestion and processing
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted using advanced cryptographic methods

### 🧠 AI-Powered Analytics
- **Advanced AI Reports**: Comprehensive treasury analysis with actionable insights
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated evaluation of concentration, volatility, and liquidity risks
- **Strategic Recommendations**: AI-generated suggestions for treasury optimization

### 🌐 Real-World Integration

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

#### Circuit Design (`solvency.circom`)
```circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Solvency() {
    signal input totalAssets;
    signal input totalLiabilities;
    signal input nonce;
    
    signal output isSolvent;
    signal output commitment;
    
    // Solvency check: assets >= liabilities
    component geq = GreaterEqualThan(64);
    geq.in[0] <== totalAssets;
    geq.in[1] <== totalLiabilities;
    isSolvent <== geq.out;
    
    // Generate commitment for privacy
    component hash = Poseidon(3);
    hash.inputs[0] <== totalAssets;
    hash.inputs[1] <== totalLiabilities;
    hash.inputs[2] <== nonce;
    commitment <== hash.out;
}
```

#### Proof Generation Process
1. **Data Collection**: Fetch DAO treasury data from blockchain
2. **Circuit Input Preparation**: Calculate total assets and liabilities
3. **Witness Generation**: Create circuit inputs with private nonce
4. **Proof Creation**: Generate zkSNARK proof using Groth16
5. **Verification**: Verify proof on-chain or off-chain

### Blockchain Integration

#### Real DAO Data Fetching
```typescript
export class RealDAOFetcher {
  async fetchRealTreasuryData(daoAddress: string): Promise<TreasurySnapshot> {
    // 1. Fetch token transfers from Etherscan
    const transfers = await this.getTokenTransfers(daoAddress);
    
    // 2. Calculate current balances
    const balances = await this.calculateBalances(transfers);
    
    // 3. Get current token prices
    const enrichedAssets = await this.enrichWithPrices(balances);
    
    return {
      daoAddress,
      assets: enrichedAssets,
      liabilities: [],
      totalValueUSD: this.calculateTotalValue(enrichedAssets),
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      isRealData: true
    };
  }
}
```

### AI Report Generation

#### Analysis Framework
```typescript
interface TreasuryMetrics {
  totalAssets: number;
  totalLiabilities: number;
  netWorth: number;
  assetDiversification: AssetDiversification;
  riskMetrics: RiskMetrics;
  runwayMonths: number;
  solvencyRatio: number;
}
```
